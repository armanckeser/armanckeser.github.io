    <h1>A Long Journey</h1>

    <p>Ahmet Armanc Keser was born in an Eastern
      Turkey city, Van, in a time of political
      disturbence, 1998. His parents Ãœmit and
      Derya, who are both from Van, decided to
      give him an unusual name at the time.
      <br>Armanc, in Kurdish, means "life purpose",
      and as he was born to the first generation
      of people who could have Kurdish names,
      they wanted to signify that.
      His father, Kurdish descent from Adilcevaz,
      Bitlis, is a topographical engineer,
      whereas his mother, Turkish, is a
      construction technican. Until 2011 they lived
      where they were born.
      <br>On October 23rd, 2011, a magnitude 7.2
      earthquake hit Van. Losing his home, Armanc
      and his family moved to the West as his
      enterance exam for high school was that
      same year.
      <br>After not going to school for more than a
      whole month, he managed to get into the
      best school in Turkey, American Robert College.
      In Robert College he found his passion
      towards human psychology and computer science.
      After finishing high-school he was accepted
      to Tufts University with full financial aid.
      This is where he found out his interest
      towards cognitive and brain sciences.
      He is now pursuing a career in research for both
      computer science and cognitive and behavior sciences.
